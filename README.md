# Data-Analytics-Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of data related projects (analysis, data science, visualizations etc) that I have completed for self learning and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython/Jupyter Notebooks.

# Contents

[Logistic Regression Model - DSJ Pakistan](https://github.com/anas-136/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Python/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20Model%20-%20DSJ%20Pakistan.ipynb): A case study on an advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

[Linear Regression on an Ecommerce Customer Data](https://github.com/anas-136/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Python/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20on%20an%20Ecommerce%20Customer%20Data.ipynb): A case study based an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

[US Housing Case Study - Linear Regression](https://github.com/anas-136/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/master/US%20Housing%20Case%20Study%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): An case study on the exploration of housing prices in different regions in the US to develop a machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict the future housing prices in the US.

[Solving for Employee Churn](https://github.com/anas-136/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/master/Solving%20for%20Employee%20Churn%20-%20%20A%20Case%20Study.ipynb): 
One of the most common problems at work is turnover. Replacing a worker earning about 50,000 dollars cost the company about 10,000 dollars or 20% of that workerâ€™s yearly income according to the Center of American Progress. Replacing a high-level employee can cost multiple of that.

Costs include:

Cost of off-boarding
Cost of hiring (advertising, interviewing, hiring)
Cost of onboarding a new person (training, management time)
Lost productivity (a new person may take 1-2 years to reach the productivity of an existing person)
As a data analyst, my job was to build a machine learning model to help the HR department create better decision making.

Based on the data, the following objectives were developed:

Identify what factors contributed to employee turnover the most.
Perform Cluster Analysis to find any meaningful pattern.
Build a model that predicts the likelihood if a certain employee will leave the company or not.
Create different retention strategies on targeted employees.  

To complete the first objective, Exploratory Data Analysis was performed in order to identify the factors that contributed to employee turnover the most. You'll find EDA in the [Solving for Employee Churn - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/anas-136/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/master/Solving%20for%20Employee%20Churn%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb).
